## A brief summary of the project

This project will be undertaken during my winter break in 2023.

The primary aim of this project is to develop a tool to scale GPA scores at my university, as the school's current search system only displays the unadjusted scores. Additionally, this project will serve as an opportunity to enhance my understanding of object-oriented programming using the Python language.
